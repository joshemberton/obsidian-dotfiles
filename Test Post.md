## Marks (bookmarks)

Not to be confused with the HTML marks, these marks/bookmarks are custom inline callouts intended for use like a bookmark. Available in a variety of colors across the Catppuccin palette. Included are two that are less dependent on light vs dark mode. They *do* style according to the preferred color scheme, but they are meant to adhere to their names!

# Code Blocks & Inline Code

`inline code block with <b>html</b> style tags`

This is a line with `inline code` in it. This sentence has `inline code with <b>html</b> tags in it and *a italic* markdown *times* 2` too!

Yet another code line, but this time with **bold** text, *italic text*, ***bold italic*** and `code with valid **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic*** markdown` in it

Complex code `{python} variable["sub"] = mything("woohoo", { "text": "some text" })` is nice to show, but without syntax highlighting, it can be a bit difficult to read.

```bash title="my python example"
This is a plaintext codeblock

*weehoo*

myVariable = someValue + 'wee'
console.log(myVariable)
```

```ts
firstLine = doNotHighlight()
secondLine = highlight()
thirdLine = doNotHighlight()
```

```plaintext

This is a <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> keyboard key. Unfortunately, this has to be done in HTML (for now).

## Links

[My Link](#)

[[Wiki Style Link]]

We should also use a link [in the middle](#) of a sentence.

And here is `[a link](/#)` in a code block

This is an [external](https://google.com) link

# Abbreviations

The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C. All abbreviations are supported by the use of a plugin. Without the plugin, they just show as standard text. The currently used plugin puts all definitions in the metadata for each note. There is at least one plugin that allows for Obsidian GLOBAL abbreviations. This might be useful for vaults that are used as documentation.

# Highlight (mark)

I need to highlight these ==very important words==. Here is some more text that should wrap onto a new line to allow us to check for spacing concerns with the new padding and margin.

# Subscript & Subscript

Water is $\large H_2O$

My equation is $\large X^2 = 5 + 3$

This is a custom syntax for a combined super and subscript. For example $\large V_{\small RMS}^2$ or $\large V^2_{\small RMS}$
